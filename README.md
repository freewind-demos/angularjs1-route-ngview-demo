AngularJS1 ngRoute ngView Demo
==============================

Use `$routeProvider` and `ngView` to load different inner pages.

Note: we have to use `#!/some-path` in `<a href=???>`. If we want to use normal path like `/some-path`, we need to enable html5 mode(in another demo).

```
npm install
npm start
```
